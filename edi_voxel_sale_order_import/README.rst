This module allows you to import sales orders from Voxel. Imports
are queued in jobs running in the background.

Configuration
=============

To configure this module you have to belong to the access group
'Voxel manager' under 'Technical Settings', then:

#. Go to *Settings > Users & Companies > Companies*, open the companies you
   want to enable Voxel communication and set 'Enable Voxel' field to True.
#. In the login list, add the corresponding login for connecting with
   Voxel to import sales orders. The final URL from where sales order will be
   imported is '<Login URL>/Outbox'.
#. Save the form and edit it again, find 'Sale Order login' field and select
   the login to be used in the imports.
#. If you have the right access, go to
   *Settings > Technical > Automation > Scheduled Actions*, find the record
   named 'Edi Voxel: Get voxel sale order' and Adjust the data corresponding
   to that scheduled action, such as the frequency with which that action will
   be executed.

Note:

This module enqueue the imports in jobs in the background.
To do that it uses queue_job module, so a configuration is required
according to that.
The jobs for impots are queued in the channel ``root.voxel_import``.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you don't need to do anything. Automatically every so
often a 'scheduled action' will be executed that will try to import from
Voxel the sales orders that have not been imported previously.

Imports will be performed for the companies that have the 'Voxel'
field checked (See configuration section).
