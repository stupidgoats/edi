Configuration
=============

To configure this module you have to belong to the access group
'Voxel manager' under 'Technical Settings', then:

#. Open a customer form view. In 'Sales & Purchases' page,
   check 'Enable Voxel' if you want to send invoices to this
   customer through Voxel.
#. Go to *Settings > Users & Companies > Companies*, open the companies you
   want to enable Voxel communication and set 'Enable Voxel' field to True.
#. In the login list, add the corresponding login for connecting with
   Voxel to send the invoices. The final URL where the invoices are going
   to be sent is '<Login URL>/Outbox'.
#. Save the form and edit it again, find 'invoice login' field and select
   the login to be used in the invoice sending.
#. Select also the 'Send mode' to set when the Invoice will be sent:

  * On validate: The invoice will be sent to Voxel automatically when
    the invoice is validated.
  * At fixed time: The invoice will be sent to Voxel automatically at
    a fixed time.
  * With delay: The invoice will be sent to Voxel automatically a certain
    time after the invoice is validated.

Note:

This module enqueue the sending invoices to Voxel in jobs in the background.
To do that it uses queue_job module, so a configuration is required
according to that.
The jobs for sending invoices to Voxel are queued in the channel
``root.voxel_export channel``.
The sending status check jobs are queued in the channel
``root.voxel_status``.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

#. Go to *Invoicing > Customers > Invoices* and create a
   new Invoice or open an existing draft invoice. Make sure that the customer
   has 'Enable Voxel' field checkbox (See configuration section).
#. Validate the invoice and it will be send to Voxel immediately or later,
   depending on the Voxel 'Send mode' chosen in the company configuration.
#. A new tab will be visible on the invoice form with the label 'Voxel'
   to show the information regarding sending the invoice to Voxel.
#. When the report is sent, you will be able to see the XML report in another
   tab next to the jobs tab.
